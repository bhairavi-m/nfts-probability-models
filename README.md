# The Art of Probability in the Digital MarketplaceðŸ“ˆ

### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the adoption patterns of two NFT exchange platforms, Coinbase and LooksRare. The goal is to understand the factors influencing new user adoption and identify any differences between the two platforms. The analysis is conducted over a 51-week period from January 2022 to December 2022, using adoption data, NFT mint activity, and Ethereum trading volume as explanatory variables. 

The models utilized included the Weibull Growth Model with Positive Duration Dependence for enthusiastic users, the Weibull-Gamma Model for general users, and the Weibull-Gamma Model with Positive Duration Dependence for active NFT traders. These models considered various factors such as token value, price fluctuations, availability of beta versions, and trading volume to estimate the probabilities of adoption over time. The main objective of this project was to build separate models for each platform and explain the differences in adoption across Coinbase and LooksRare. I further explore the possibility of a unifying model specification that captures the observed differences between the two platforms. Different probability models were employed to analyze the adoption of Coinbase NFTs among enthusiastic users and the general user population, as well as the adoption of LooksRare among active NFT traders.
